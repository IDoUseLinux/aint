# aint (AI, Ain't)
A very simple Python Script spoofing ai-generated texts into "non human" texts. It's very simple as this program basically pareses the input and replaces similar looking characters with each other. This will exploit the fact that AIs are perfect and don't make a lot of grammatical mistakes. This will increase the "roughness" of the text which will trick the AI detectors into thinking that it is not actually AI generated text. This works for most AI-detectors. I am planning on reworking the GUI later with a decent GUI library, namely CustomTkinter. Which is just Tkinter just better.
